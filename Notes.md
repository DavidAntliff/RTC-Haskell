## Useful Things To Remember

### Coordinate System

The RTC system is left-handed. For example, with y axis up, x axis to the right, 
the z axis is away from you.

### Dot Product

The smaller the dot product, the larger the angle between two vectors.
A value of 1 means the vectors are identical.
A value of -1 means they are parallel but in opposite directions.
If the vectors are normalized, the dot product is the cosine of the angle between them.
